Subscript: submission
=====================

Spec section: `### Subscript`, the last section of `translation_approach.md`, on
branch `subscript-htmd` of the
[ASPLightNext/htmd](https://github.com/ASPLightNext/htmd) fork (based on
upstream `2e7bf3a`).

1. Team contributions
---------------------

* Matzhan Aruzhan: Prompted the LLM (claude-opus-5-5) to write the Subscript
  section of `translation_approach.md`, which specifies how `<sub>` is
  translated to pulldown-cmark's `~a~` syntax and when it falls back to HTML,
  and ran its six review rounds.
* Zhexenbiyev Arsen: Created the team's fork of htmd and the `subscript-htmd`
  branch, and opened the team's pull request upstream.
* Khamzin Daulet: Verified that the project builds and passes the CI checks
  (`cargo build`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`) on the branch, recorded the
  output below, and ran review round 7 of the Subscript section (part 5).
* Dustin Johnson: Verified the Windows build and tested subscript boundary cases with pulldown-cmark 0.13.4, then clarified the specification’s whitespace and fallback rules and added three examples.

2. Output of "Verify that you can compile and run the project in the current git repo."

Prompt used to write the spec section
-------------------------------------

Prompting claude-opus-5-5 through the Kasper CLI agent with:

> Add a "Subscript" section to the end of translation_approach.md specifying how
> htmd translates `<sub>` to pulldown-cmark 0.13.4's `~a~` syntax. Follow the
> conventions of the existing sections, base every rule on pulldown-cmark's
> source, and keep it concise. Include an examples table formatted like this:
>
> | Description             | HTML in            | Faithful expected  |
> | ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
> | Simple subscript        | `<sub>a</sub>`     | `~a~`              |
> | Intraword subscript     | `H<sub>2</sub>O`   | `H<sub>2</sub>O`   |

3. Review rounds
----------------

Each round used a fresh reviewer with the same prompt (shown in part 4). We
applied only small, targeted edits, never the reviewer's rewrites. When
reviewers disagreed, we tested the claim against pulldown-cmark 0.13.4.

The table was made by prompting claude-opus-5-5 through the Kasper CLI agent
with:

> From the six review rounds of the Subscript section in this conversation,
> make a GitHub-flavored Markdown table with the columns "Round", "Findings",
> and "Main changes made". "Findings" is the count the reviewer reported in
> that round. "Main changes made" is one sentence: the main changes applied in
> that round, separated by semicolons, with rejected findings in parentheses.
> For the last round, write "Findings below, all applied". Align the columns,
> like this example:
>
> | Round | Findings | Main changes made                                                                              |
> | ----- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | 1     | 15       | Rule 1 vs rule 2 contradiction; added NFC, apostrophe and hyphen variants, digits inside words |
> | 2     | 11       | Stress marks (`ма́ма`) no longer split words; rule 2 written as a grammar                        |
> | 3     | 10       | NFC, not NFKC (ligature `ﬁ`); final sigma in `lower()`                                         |
> | 4     | 5        | Findings below, all applied                                                                    |

Output:

| Round | Findings | Main changes made                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 8 | 3 | Clarified which emitted characters determine subscript validity, specified where edge whitespace stays on fallback, and added three boundary examples. |

4. Round 6 review
-----------------

Prompting claude-opus-5-5 through the Kasper CLI agent, with a read-only
reviewer sub-agent given the system prompt and prompt below, produced the
following output; strikethrough would mark output we deemed incorrect or
irrelevant, but none was needed. We reproduced findings 1, 2, and 4 with
pulldown-cmark 0.13.4, and finding 3 is a real gap in the spec text. The
reviewer's "not verified" note is also resolved: pulldown-cmark's
`is_punctuation('©')` is true.

System prompt:

> HTML-to-Markdown converter. Report only concrete errors: factual mistakes,
> contradictions, wrong examples, and missing edge cases that would produce
> incorrect output. Do not propose rewrites, style changes, or new prose. Each
> finding: one or two sentences, with the evidence.

Prompt:

> Review the section named "Subscript" in subscript-wt/translation_approach.md
> (the last section of that file).
>
> Context: the rest of that file is the established spec; read the "Translating
> HTML nodes", "Emphasis and strong emphasis", and "Math" sections for

> .review-ref/ (firstpass.rs: delim_run_can_open/delim_run_can_close near line

5. Review (round 7)
------------------------

Prompting Claude Sonnet 5.5 (`claude-sonnet-5-5`), with a fresh read-only
reviewer sub-agent (the `Explore` agent) given the prompt below in one message,
produced the following output. Round 7 reviewed the section as
it stands on `subscript-htmd` (`c98556c`), after all round 6 findings were
applied. Unlike rounds 1 to 6, it used Claude Sonnet 5.5 rather than
`claude-opus-5-5`. The session ran at high effort; the sub-agent's own effort
level was not set separately.

The prompt keeps the system prompt and the task of part 4, with four changes:
it names `translation_approach.md` by path, since there is no `.review-ref/`
copy of the pulldown-cmark source, so the reviewer fetched v0.13.4 from GitHub;
it forbids changing the repository; it allows "Findings: 0"; and it asks for a
list of what the reviewer checked. The local scratch directory is shortened to
`<scratchpad>` below.

The output below is the reviewer's report, unedited apart from the shortened
scratch path. No finding is struck out, because none has been shown to be
wrong, but neither is fully confirmed. Finding 1 is confirmed by reading the
spec: the emphasis section does say that examining the text before and after
an element is not implemented. Finding 2 has not been reproduced with
pulldown-cmark 0.13.4, because no Rust toolchain was available for this round,
but its reasoning from the source is consistent with the part 4 findings. Both
findings were then applied to the spec with small edits: step 3 now says an
unmatched `~~` run blocks the closing `~`, and step 5 now says it needs the
emitted Markdown around the element, unlike the emphasis section.

Output:

> Review of the "Subscript" section (`translation_approach.md:736-818`) against
> pulldown-cmark v0.13.4, source copied to `<scratchpad>/review7/`. I found one
> contradiction with the established spec and one wrong rationale. No wrong
> table row and no wrong expected output.
>
> 1. **Step 5 contradicts the emphasis section.** Step 5
>    (`translation_approach.md:790-795`) needs the emitted Markdown character
>    before the opening `~` and after the closing `~`. The after-character may
>    come from a later sibling, including a pass-through `<span>` (`:794-795`).
>    The emphasis section says (`:509-518`) that examining text "preceding and
>    following" is "not implemented" and that "the current implementation makes
>    this difficult to determine". That section therefore chose the conservative
>    edge-character rule. The Subscript section assumes the lookahead exists
>    without saying the convention changed.
>
> 2. **The step 3 rationale for `~~` is wrong as stated.** Step 3
>    (`:785-788`) says a `~~` run inside the content, "such as a strikethrough
>    written by another handler", "stops the closing `~` from matching". A
>    balanced `~~b~~` does not stop it.
>    * In `~a ~~b~~ c~`, the `~~` closer matches its `~~` opener. `find_match`
>      (`parse.rs:1627-1660`) then calls `truncate(matching_ix)`
>      (`parse.rs:1587-1593`) and sets no lower bound. The final `~` still
>      matches the stack entry at index 0, giving `<sub>a <del>b</del> c</sub>`.
>    * The `super_sub.txt` example `~This ~~is stricken.~` shows the same: an
>      opening `~~` inside is harmless.
>    * What blocks the closer is a failed closer-capable run. Examples are a
>      `~~` closer with no opener, as in `~a b~~ c~`, and a stray `^`. A failed
>      match calls `set_lowerbound` (`parse.rs:1597-1599`), which sets
>      `lower_bounds[TILDES] = stack.len()`.
>    * A strikethrough at the content edge (`<sub><del>a</del></sub>`) does
>      fail, but only because `~` plus `~~` adjoin to make a run of three, which
>      is text (`firstpass.rs:935`). The step 3 rule still produces safe output.
>      Only its stated reason is wrong.
>
> Findings: 2
>
> Checked and found correct:
>
> * **Opener rule** (`firstpass.rs:2254-2295`): returns false if there is no next
>   character or the next character is whitespace. It returns true at `ix == 0`.
>   Otherwise the previous character must be whitespace or punctuation. The
>   `prev == '~'` branch at `:2289` is redundant because `~` is itself
>   punctuation.
> * **Closer rule** (`firstpass.rs:2300-2337`): `ix == 0` gives false,
>   whitespace before gives false, and end of text gives true. A single `~`
>   closes when the next character is whitespace or punctuation, or when the
>   previous character is `~` (`:2332`).
> * **"Start of line" and "end of line"** match the code. `ix` is relative to

> * **Escapes:** `\~` is honored (`super_sub.txt` "Backslash escapes"). A `~`
>   after an escaped `\~` can still open and close, so `~a\~~` and `~\~a~` work.
> * **Neighbouring tildes:** `~a~~b~` reads as text. The `~~` run fails to match
>   and sets the lower bound.
> * **`~a.~.b~ c~`:** the inner `~` is both open and close (prev `.`, next `.`)
>   and closes the outer subscript.
> * **`~a^ b~` without escaping** reads as text. A failed `^` closer sets the
>   shared TILDES bound. The `\^` escape is needed only when superscript is
>   enabled, since `^` is registered only then (`firstpass.rs:2371`).
> * **Rest of the section:**
>   * All 12 table rows are consistent with the code.
>   * The `\~\~` escaping of runs of one or two, and of every `~` in a run of

### Prompt used

```text
Help me develop a small, evidence-backed revision to the Subscript section
of translation_approach.md for our ECE 4793 draft. My contribution is to
verify and clarify how whitespace and neighboring characters affect the
decision to emit Markdown subscript or fall back to HTML.

Read the current Subscript section, especially steps 4–6 and the Pure-mode
paragraph. Use the rest of the document only to understand its terminology
and conventions. Check Cargo.lock for the pinned pulldown-cmark version and
use that version for parser verification. Use ENABLE_SUBSCRIPT and state
which other parser options you enable. Work in my local clone. Do not
implement the feature, rewrite the whole section, rename any files, or
commit or push changes.

1. Establish the rule before proposing edits.

   Explain in plain language when a single opening or closing tilde is
   recognized as a subscript delimiter. Distinguish characters in the
   original HTML from characters in the Markdown actually emitted. Explain
   the order of operations: trim the subscript content, move any edge
   whitespace as specified, then determine what touches each delimiter.
   Identify any point where the current wording allows two reasonable
   interpretations.

2. Verify concrete examples with the pinned Markdown parser.

   Start with these inputs:

   - H<sub>2</sub>O
   - H<sub> 2 </sub>O
   - H<sub> 2</sub>O
   - H<sub>2 </sub>O
   - x (<sub>i</sub>) y
   - H<sub>2</sub><span>O</span>

   For each input, derive the candidate Markdown from the current spec.
   Where the spec calls for HTML fallback, also try the Markdown form
   that would have been emitted without the fallback. Run the candidate
   Markdown through pulldown-cmark and record whether it produces a
   subscript and what visible spacing it preserves.

   For the span example, distinguish a mode that passes through the
   span's text from one that emits the span as HTML. Do not assume the
   emitted neighbor is the same in both modes.

   If htmd does not implement the proposed rule on this branch, test
   candidate Markdown directly with a temporary parser harness. Do not
   report a parser result as an htmd conversion result. Show what you
   actually ran. If you cannot execute a case, label it as an expectation.

3. Propose the smallest useful specification change.

   Give me exact replacement text for any sentence you recommend
   changing, and suggest up to three example rows that add coverage beyond
   the existing table. Use the document's current style, including its
   visible-space notation where useful. State the expected Faithful output
   and explain any different Pure-mode behavior.

   Write the rule so someone implementing it can tell which characters to
   inspect and when to fall back. Keep the rule independent of a particular
   traversal or buffering strategy. Preserve existing decisions about
   attributes, nesting, and escaping unless a verified case directly
   contradicts one. If the rule is already clear and correct, say so and
   propose only examples that demonstrate something the table does not
   already cover.

4. Give me a review record.

   Return:
   - The exact commands run and their results.
   - A table of inputs, candidate Markdown, and observed parser behavior.
   - A numbered list of actionable spec findings, with the count.
   - The exact wording and example rows you recommend adding.
   - A one-sentence summary of the proposed change for our review-round
     table. Describe it as proposed until I apply it.

Do not edit the shared files yet. I want to review the evidence and decide
which changes to make.

### Review output

#### 1. Rule established

With `ENABLE_SUBSCRIPT` enabled, a single `~` opens a subscript when it is followed by a non-whitespace character and preceded by the start of the line, whitespace, or punctuation. It closes one when preceded by a non-whitespace character and followed by whitespace, punctuation, or the end of the line. A tilde inside the original HTML does not determine this: the parser checks characters in the Markdown candidate, including the translated subscript content and the output of neighboring elements.

The intended order is: trim the translated content’s edge whitespace, move that whitespace outside the would-be `~…~`, then test the delimiter boundaries in the prospective Markdown output for the current mode. For example, `H<sub> 2 </sub>O` becomes `H ~2~ O`, so both delimiters have whitespace neighbors and the parser recognizes the subscript.

There are two ambiguities worth resolving in the current wording:

- Step 5 says to inspect “emitted Markdown,” but does not explicitly say this means the *prospective, mode-specific* output after step 4—not the neighboring characters in the input HTML.
- If the candidate fails and Faithful mode falls back to HTML, steps 4–5 do not say whether the fallback retains the original edge whitespace inside `<sub>` or keeps it moved outside. Both readings are plausible; the parser tests below show their different output.

The single-tilde flanking rules themselves are already stated clearly. Nothing in these tests requires changing the existing choices about attributes, nesting, or escaping.

#### 2. Parser verification

`Cargo.lock` pins `pulldown-cmark` **0.13.4**; `cargo tree -i pulldown-cmark` also reported `pulldown-cmark v0.13.4`. The temporary harness enabled **`ENABLE_SUBSCRIPT | ENABLE_STRIKETHROUGH`**; all other parser options were disabled. It detected `Event::Start(Tag::Subscript)` and rendered the events to HTML. These are parser results—not htmd conversion results. A raw-HTML fallback can render a `<sub>` element even when there is no Markdown `Tag::Subscript` event.

In the table, `␣` denotes a literal space; spaces passed to the harness were ordinary U+0020 spaces.

| Input / case | Candidate Markdown tested | Parser observation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `H<sub>2</sub>O`, Faithful fallback | `H<sub>2</sub>O` | No Markdown subscript event; raw HTML renders `<sub>2</sub>`. |
| Same, hypothetical Markdown form | `H~2~O` | No subscript event; tildes remain literal. `H` blocks opening and `O` blocks closing. |
| `H<sub> 2 </sub>O` | `H␣~2~␣O` | Subscript event; rendered output is `H␣<sub>2</sub>␣O`. The moved spaces remain outside the subscript. |
| `H<sub> 2</sub>O`, fallback retaining original whitespace | `H<sub>␣2</sub>O` | No Markdown subscript event; raw HTML retains the space inside `<sub>`. |
| Same, fallback after moving whitespace | `H␣<sub>2</sub>O` | No Markdown subscript event; the space is outside `<sub>`. |
| Same, hypothetical Markdown form | `H␣~2~O` | No subscript event; `O` blocks closing. |
| `H<sub>2 </sub>O`, fallback retaining original whitespace | `H<sub>2␣</sub>O` | No Markdown subscript event; raw HTML retains the space inside `<sub>`. |
| Same, fallback after moving whitespace | `H<sub>2</sub>␣O` | No Markdown subscript event; the space is outside `<sub>`. |
| Same, hypothetical Markdown form | `H~2~␣O` | No subscript event; `H` blocks opening. |
| `x (<sub>i</sub>) y` | `x (~i~) y` | Subscript event; rendered output is `x␣(<sub>i</sub>)␣y`. Parentheses are acceptable punctuation neighbors. |
| `H<sub>2</sub><span>O</span>`, Faithful | `H<sub>2</sub><span>O</span>` | No Markdown subscript event; raw `<sub>` and `<span>` HTML render. `H` blocks opening. |
| Same, Faithful hypothetical Markdown form | `H~2~<span>O</span>` | No subscript event; `H` still blocks opening. The emitted character after the closing tilde would be `<`. |
| Same, Pure | `H2O` | No Markdown subscript event; the subscript is emitted as plain content and the span’s text passes through. |
| Same, Pure hypothetical Markdown form | `H~2~O` | No subscript event; the emitted neighbor is `O` (and `H` also blocks opening). |

For the span case, the difference between modes is real even though `H` already makes this particular subscript fail: Faithful emits `<span>O</span>`, while Pure emits the text `O`. A more discriminating candidate, `(~i~<span>O</span>)`, produced a Markdown subscript event; its Pure text-neighbor counterpart `(~i~O)` did not.

**What I ran:** `cargo tree -i pulldown-cmark` reported version 0.13.4. I created and removed a temporary crate whose manifest pinned `pulldown-cmark = "=0.13.4"`.

*[Dustin’s note: The command list was blank in the copied response, so the exact harness command is not recorded.]*

The harness used `Parser::new_ext(markdown, Options::ENABLE_SUBSCRIPT | Options::ENABLE_STRIKETHROUGH)`, detected `Event::Start(Tag::Subscript)`, and called `pulldown_cmark::html::push_html`. It tested the candidates listed above. The additional-candidate run exited 0 with a harmless unused-import warning.

#### 3. Proposed specification change

I recommend replacing steps 4–5 with the following. This makes the characters under inspection, fallback behavior, and mode difference explicit while leaving the other existing decisions intact:

> 4. For a Markdown candidate, trim leading and trailing whitespace from the translated content and place those characters immediately outside the would-be `~content~` pair.
> 5. Test that candidate against the complete prospective Markdown output for the current mode. Inspect the emitted characters immediately adjacent to each tilde, including the first and last emitted characters of the content and output from neighboring elements; do not use adjacent characters from the input HTML. Apply the single-tilde flanking rules above, and retain the fallback when an unescaped `~` or `\` is immediately outside the pair. If either delimiter is invalid, Faithful mode serializes the original `<sub>` element as HTML, preserving its original edge whitespace; Pure mode emits the relocated edge whitespace and the trimmed content without tildes. A letter immediately before the opening tilde or after the closing tilde blocks that delimiter, and a neighboring tilde merges with it: `~a~~b~` reads as text. A neighbor can come from any element, including a `<span>` whose emitted Markdown differs by mode.

Three useful additions to the existing table:

| Description | HTML in | Faithful expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Leading edge whitespace with an intraword neighbor | `H<sub>␣2</sub>O` | `H<sub>␣2</sub>O` |
| Trailing edge whitespace with an intraword neighbor | `H<sub>2␣</sub>O` | `H<sub>2␣</sub>O` |
| Mode-dependent span neighbor | `(<sub>i</sub><span>O</span>)` | `(~i~<span>O</span>)` |

For the first two rows, Pure would emit `H␣2O` and `H2␣O`, respectively: no HTML and no subscript markup. For the span row, Pure would emit `(iO)`; Faithful’s HTML span leaves `<` next to the closing tilde, while Pure’s text neighbor `O` blocks it.

#### 4. Review record

**Actionable findings: 3**

1. Clarify that boundary checks use the complete prospective Markdown output for the active mode, after edge-whitespace relocation—not input-HTML neighbors.
2. Specify what happens to edge whitespace when step 5 falls back: retain it inside the original Faithful HTML element; in Pure, emit it outside the plain content.
3. Add asymmetric edge-whitespace and mode-dependent span examples; the current table does not cover those cases.

**Commands and results:** `cargo tree -i pulldown-cmark` → `pulldown-cmark v0.13.4`; the temporary pinned-parser harness → exit 0, with the observations tabulated here; `git status --short` → `M subscript_submission.md`. That submission-file change was already present and left untouched. I did not edit `translation_approach.md` or any shared files.

**Review-round summary (proposed):** Clarifies mode-specific delimiter checks and edge-whitespace handling on fallback, and adds asymmetric-whitespace and mode-dependent-span examples.

## Final submission

### Dustin Johnson

GitHub userid: `drj228`

#### Contributions

Finalized the Subscript specification’s block fallback, adjacency, and tilde-escaping rules through two LLM review rounds and committed the changes in `a5326db`.

#### Specification review rounds

These rounds cover only the final submission; draft review rounds are recorded above.

| Round | Necessary findings | Optional/trivial findings | Main changes made |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 6 | Added block-descendant fallback and its precedence over Pure-mode combining, defined adjacency independently of the existing combining implementation, and clarified escaping complete tilde runs. |
| 2 | 0 | 4 | Confirmed that all three necessary findings were resolved; only optional wording suggestions remained, and no further changes were made. |

#### Last specification review

Model: Claude Opus 5.5, Medium effort.

Tool: Claude browser chat, using an attached copy of the updated specification.

The prompt below requested workspace access, but Claude could not access my computer and explicitly reported reviewing the attachment instead. Its parser tests used handwritten Markdown candidates, not htmd conversion output.

Prompt:

```text
Read the saved translation_approach.md directly from the current VS Code workspace, including its uncommitted changes. Do not clone the repository or use an earlier attachment.

Read AGENTS.md, then review only the Subscript section and its related shared-context bullet.

Check whether these findings are resolved:
1. Block descendants use the Faithful HTML-block fallback. Pure mode translates children in the incoming context, with this rule taking precedence over combining.
2. Adjacency is defined independently of can_combine and handles differing attributes and non-text children deterministically.
3. Every tilde in a run of three or more is escaped at text-node starts and inside subscript content.

Check for new substantive contradictions between the rules and examples. Verify uncertain parser behavior against pulldown-cmark 0.13.4 with ENABLE_SUBSCRIPT | ENABLE_STRIKETHROUGH. For block fallback cases, distinguish rendered HTML from its parsed DOM.

Do not edit any files, implement anything, commit, or push.

Separate necessary corrections from optional or trivial findings. Give a concrete counterexample and the smallest appropriate fix for each necessary correction. Do not repeat resolved findings without new evidence.

State the actual file path inspected and exactly what you executed versus inspected. Finish with finding counts and a one-sentence review-table summary. If only trivial suggestions remain, say so.
```

Claude’s response:

> The heading case keeps its structure. The one failing case (a subscript holding a `<p>` inside a paragraph) can’t come from real HTML, because the HTML parser closes the `<p>` first. I’ll clean up.
>
> I found **no necessary corrections** in the file you attached: all three findings are resolved and your rewording introduces no contradictions. Only four optional or trivial suggestions remain.
>
> ### Which file I reviewed
>
> I couldn’t read your VS Code workspace: no device-bridge tools are connected, so your computer isn’t reachable from here. I reviewed `/mnt/user-data/uploads/01b51335-attachment.txt`, the file you attached with this message, not a clone or an earlier attachment. It has 838 CRLF lines. I’m assuming it is your saved `translation_approach.md`, but I can’t confirm that.
>
> ### Inspected versus executed
>
> - **Inspected:**
>   - `AGENTS.md`, from the copy in my workspace taken at `a31bed2`.
>   - The type 7 bullet in “Translating HTML nodes”, the whole Subscript section, and the emphasis run rule.
>   - A diff of the attachment against the file I sent you last. It differs only in your rewording of the shared bullet, the two row names, step 1, the tilde and adjacency sentences, and the Pure paragraph.
> - **Executed:**
>   - A temporary harness on pulldown-cmark 0.13.4 (tag `v0.13.4`, `38e4d08`) with `ENABLE_SUBSCRIPT | ENABLE_STRIKETHROUGH` and no other options. It ran 10 handwritten Markdown inputs.
>   - Headless Chrome `--dump-dom` on 5 of the rendered results, to see the parsed DOM.
>   - No htmd conversions; htmd has no `<sub>` handler yet.
>   - All temporary files deleted.
>
> ### The three findings
>
> **1. Block descendants: resolved.**
>
> - **Faithful, block context:** step 1 now applies the HTML-block form before the other checks, and attributes no longer bypass it. The row’s `<sub>⏎<p>a</p><p>b</p></sub>` renders as itself, and its DOM matches the source except for a leading `⏎` text node.
> - **Faithful, inline context (new behavior):** this case now reaches the `~…~` steps. In a heading, `# ~<p>a</p>~` renders `<h1><sub><p>a</p></sub></h1>`, and the DOM keeps that structure. So does `# x ~<p>a</p><p>b</p>~ y`.
> - **Paragraphs:** inside a paragraph the same Markdown would break, but HTML parsing never produces `<p>…<sub><p>`. The case reachable through an inline ancestor such as `<em>` breaks with or without a subscript, as I reported last time.
> - **Pure:** the block rule takes precedence over combining. `a⏎⏎b` gives two paragraphs, and `a⏎⏎~b~` gives `<p>a</p><p><sub>b</sub></p>`.
>
> **2. Adjacency: resolved.** Adjacency no longer depends on `can_combine`, and the text explicitly covers differing attributes and children. Faithful mode serializes every member of a run, and Pure mode combines the eligible ones.
>
> **3. Tilde runs: resolved.** Your shorter wording keeps the rule. The parser confirms it: `*a*\~~~b c~~~*d*\~~~e` produces a strikethrough, while `*a*\~\~\~b c~~~*d*\~\~\~e` reads as plain text.
>
> ### Optional or trivial findings
>
> 1. **“This choice” now points at the wrong sentence.** In the type 7 bullet, your new sentence sits between “…the resulting context is inline.” and “This choice is a tradeoff”. “This choice” now seems to mean the subscript fallback rather than writing type 7 HTML as raw inlines. Moving the new sentence to the end of the bullet fixes it.
> 2. **“Immediately adjacent `<sub>` siblings” can be read two ways.** It could be taken to mean neighboring elements, ignoring whitespace text between them. For `<sub>a</sub> <sub>b</sub>`, that reading gives a different but valid result: Pure would write `~a b~` instead of `~a~ ~b~`, and both parse. Adding “with no node, not even whitespace text, between them” removes the doubt.
> 3. **“Apply the existing blank-line encoding rules” is vague.** Naming them would help: the type 6 `&#13;`/`&#10;` encoding of blank lines, and the blank line before and after an HTML block.
> 4. **“Every `~` is escaped at a text-node start” reads loosely.** It is clearer as “every `~` of a run of three or more that begins a text node, and of any such run inside subscript content”.
>
> ### Result
>
> - **Necessary corrections:** 0
> - **Optional or trivial:** 4
> - **Review-table summary:** All three findings are resolved and the rewording introduces no contradictions, so only trivial wording suggestions remain.
