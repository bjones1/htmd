Project 2 submission
====================

Team members are Armanzhan Onggarbay, Nurlybek Orynbassar, Miras Shaltayev, and Aidyn Tazhibay. The specification consists of the file [testing_approach.md](testing_approach.md).

Draft submission
----------------

### Contributions

* Armanzhan Onggarbay: (Armanzhan's contributions)
* Nurlybek Orynbassar: Wrote the "Whitespace" section of `testing_approach.md` and revised it over four LLM review rounds.
* Miras Shaltayev: Wrote the initial draft of `testing_approach.md`.
* Aidyn Tazhibay: Wrote the "Escaping" section of `testing_approach.md` and revised it over five LLM review rounds.

### Compiler test

The following statements summarize LLM output on each team member's computer, based on the prompt "Verify that you can compile and run the project in the current git repo."

#### Armanzhan Onggarbay

(Summarized LLM output)

#### Nurlybek Orynbassar

Claude Opus 5.5 (Claude Code 2.1.319) found that the project builds and runs on this machine with no changes: `cargo build` finished with no errors or warnings, and `cargo clippy -- --deny warnings` exited with status 0 (it touched `src/lib.rs` first to force a fresh check instead of a cached one). Since `htmd` is a library, it ran the bundled examples: `cargo run --example simple` exited with code 0 and prints nothing, because it only runs `assert_eq!` checks which held, and `cargo run --example table` printed the expected Markdown table. `cargo test` passed 267 tests across all suites with 0 failures and one test ignored in the source.

#### Miras Shaltayev

Claude Sonnet 5.5 found that `cargo` was installed in `~/.cargo/bin` but not on the `PATH`, and fixed this with `export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"`. After that, `cargo build` finished with no errors, `cargo run --example simple` exited with code 0 (it prints nothing, since the example only runs `assert_eq!` checks that passed), and `cargo test` passed in every test group, with one test ignored in the source. It did not run `cargo clippy -- --deny warnings`, which the CI also requires.

#### Aidyn Tazhibay

Claude Opus 5.5 (Claude Code, medium effort) found that the project compiles and runs on this machine with Rust 1.99.1, which I had installed with `rustup-init`: `cargo build` finished with no errors, and `cargo clippy -- --deny warnings` reported no warnings. Since `htmd` is a library, it ran the bundled examples: `cargo run --example simple` printed nothing, because it only runs `assert_eq!` checks which held, and `cargo run --example table` printed the expected Markdown table. `cargo test` passed 267 tests across all suites with 0 failures and one test ignored in the source.

### Spec review rounds

| Section | Round | Findings | Main changes made |
| ------- | ----- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Whitespace | 1 | 14 | `<br>` is raw HTML in Faithful mode; links may hold edge whitespace; `<code>` is not preformatted; added `<pre>` and fenced-code loss, NBSP moved out of emphasis, tables need `ENABLE_TABLES` |
| Whitespace | 2 | 11 | Leading whitespace in a leading emphasis is not idempotent; code span with a line ending collapses all whitespace; `<pre>` in a cell collapses only in pipe tables; emphasis next to punctuation stays raw HTML; raw inline edges excluded from "does not matter"; rule 2 allows `ENABLE_TABLES` |
| Whitespace | 3 | 6 | Code spans: trim before the line-ending test; headerless-table `<pre>` writes blank lines as `&#10;` and has the leading-LF bug; item 5 limited to Markdown blocks; lossy-case exception stated against "Known failures" |
| Whitespace | 4 | 8 | Leading-emphasis bug also at the document root; raw `<code>` keeps collapsed edge whitespace; `<textarea>` and `<pre>` in a list have the leading-LF bug; htmd and pulldown-cmark share one whitespace set |
| Escaping | 1 | 11 | Code rule limited to Faithful mode; `&lt;<span>div</span>` moved to over-escapes; round trip compared after the Whitespace equivalences and pulldown-cmark's spelling; scope narrowed to text nodes; ATX closing `#` and `!` before a link added |
| Escaping | 2 | 11 | Over-escape redefined as an escape the position does not need, with both causes; `<` rule stated; `\|` escaped even inside code spans in pipe-table cells; text in an HTML block is not escaped, text in a raw HTML inline is; idempotency reason fixed |
| Escaping | 3 | 9 | Over-escape after the opening markup of an ATX heading or raw inline; `<` rule points to `escape.rs`; every `\|` in a cell's Markdown is escaped; NBSP and `</ a` near misses; `ENABLE_TABLES` for every pipe-table case |
| Escaping | 4 | 10 | Code-span delimiter rule corrected; `-` run needs `---` and `- - -` beside `--foo`; list and blockquote markup start a line; form feed added as a closer; near misses for item 5; block-separation failures filed as list bugs |
| Escaping | 5 | 5 | Text nodes after a list or `<pre>` sibling added; leading whitespace is dropped only at the start of a block; any HTML whitespace closes a marker; over- and under-escape defined once, first; only conditional markers in a cell need a reason |

### Last LLM review

#### Whitespace

Claude Opus 5.5 (Claude Code), with the prompt: "Review the section named "Whitespace" in testing_approach.md, writing findings to review.md. Verify each claim about htmd and pulldown-cmark behavior by running throwaway code, and do not commit it. Do not edit testing_approach.md."

Findings which were not applied are struck through.

> **Review of "Whitespace" in testing_approach.md (round 4)**
>
> This reviews the section as of 91e886c ("Whitespace: apply review round 3").
> Every claim was checked with a throwaway integration test (since deleted). Each
> input was converted with `convert_faithful`, rendered with `render_markdown(md,
> CommonMarkOptions::empty())` (or `ENABLE_TABLES` for pipe tables), and the
> rendered HTML was converted again to check idempotency (property 3). Outputs
> are quoted as Rust string literals.
>
> **Summary**
>
> Round 3 is applied fully. E1 (trim first, then test for a line ending), O1
> (headerless-table `<pre>`), O2 ("written as Markdown") and O3 (the exception to
> "Known failures") all hold now. Two claims are wrong. Item 6 places the
> leading-emphasis bug too narrowly: it also happens at the document root, which
> is where htmd usually starts, since it is often given a fragment (E1). Item 2
> says the trim comes first, but the raw `<code>` fallback is written from the
> untrimmed content, so its edge whitespace comes back (E2). There are three
> omissions. `<textarea>` has the same leading line feed bug as `<pre>` (O1). ~~A
> vertical tab at the end of a paragraph is a new idempotency failure (O2).~~
> Item 7 suggests that htmd and pulldown-cmark use different whitespace sets,
> but they use the same one (O3).
>
> **Errors**
>
> **E1. The leading-emphasis bug is not limited to `<p>` and `<blockquote>`**
>
> Item 6 says "Leading whitespace in an emphasis which starts a `<p>` or a
> `<blockquote>` stays as a leading space". The trigger is wider: an emphasis
> which starts a Markdown paragraph, wherever that paragraph comes from. The
> document root (a fragment with no `<p>`, or `<body>`) fails in the same way:

> **Omissions and inaccuracies**
>
> **O1. `<textarea>` has the leading line feed bug too**
>
> The HTML parser drops a line feed directly after `<textarea>`, as it does after
> `<pre>` ([HTML § 13.2.6.4.7](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#parsing-main-inbody),
> "textarea" start tag). htmd copies `<textarea>` verbatim and, again, does not
> write the line feed back:
>
> * `<textarea>\n\na</textarea>` gives `"<textarea>\na</textarea>"`, then
>   `"<textarea>a</textarea>"` (not idempotent).
> * `<textarea>\na</textarea>` gives `"<textarea>a</textarea>"` (idempotent, same
>   DOM).
>
> The section names `<textarea>` only in the "does not matter" scope list, so
> this case would be missed. Item 1 could add: "The same applies to
> `<textarea>`." The bug also reproduces for a `<pre>` in a list item
> (`<ul><li><pre>\n\na</pre></li></ul>` gives `"*   <pre>\n    a</pre>"`, then
> `"*   <pre>a</pre>"`), which "the leading line feed bug applies there too" covers
> only for tables.
>
> ~~`<listing>`, which the parser treats like `<pre>`, is not handled as
> preformatted at all: `<listing>a  b</listing>` gives `"<listing>a b</listing>"`.
> It is obsolete, so a sentence would do, if anything.~~

> ~~**O2. A trailing vertical tab is a new idempotency failure**~~

> ~~U+000B is not HTML whitespace (the intro's list is right) and is not in
> htmd's block-edge trim (`is_document_whitespace` in `src/util/text.rs:23` is

> Item 7 says "pulldown-cmark counts Unicode whitespace for flanking, and htmd

> Read with CommonMark's definition of Unicode whitespace (Zs plus tab, LF, FF and
> CR), "also" suggests that htmd moves those three out of emphasis when
> pulldown-cmark would not need it. In fact pulldown-cmark tests flanking with
> `char::is_whitespace` (`firstpass.rs:2266`, `2293`, `2311`, `2336`), which is the
> same `White_Space` property, and so it departs from the spec in the same way:
> `"*\u{85}a*"`, `"*\u{2028}a*"` and `"*\u{b}a*"` all stay literal. The two
> sets agree, which is why every case round 3 tried is idempotent. U+200B is in
> neither: htmd keeps it inside (`"a*\u{200b}b*c"`), and it renders as emphasis.
>
> Suggested change: "htmd trims emphasis with Rust's `White_Space`, which is wider
> than CommonMark's Unicode whitespace (it adds U+000B, U+0085, U+2028 and
> U+2029). pulldown-cmark tests flanking with the same property, so an edge
> U+00A0 or U+2003 moves out of emphasis like an ASCII space (lossy) and the
> result is stable."
>
> **O4. Smaller points**
>
> * **Item 2, "Known failures".** A code span with a remaining line ending fails
>   idempotency. "Known failures" requires such a case to be either "a bug to
>   fix" or given its own test of the unstable second Markdown. Item 1 calls its
>   case "a bug". Item 2 does not say which this is. The same failure occurs in a
>   pipe-table cell (`<code>a\nb</code>` gives `"| <code>a b</code> |"`, then
>   ``"| `a b` |"``).
> * **The inline-element sentence.** "a pair of inputs under these rules never
>   varies it" can be read as forbidding `<em>a</em> <em>b</em>` versus
>   `<em>a</em>\n<em>b</em>`. That pair is a valid test of rule 1 and gives
>   `"*a* *b*"` for both. The intent seems to be "never adds or removes it".
> * ~~**Item 6, raw-inline edges.** `<p><span> a</span></p>` keeps its leading space
>   (`"<span> a</span>"`) and is idempotent. This is consistent with the scope
>   sentence, but "does not matter" rule 3 says a block's leading whitespace is
>   dropped "except for the leading emphasis case". A raw inline at the start of
>   a block is a second exception.~~
>
> **Verified as stated**
>
> * **Intro.** NBSP is never collapsed. The exception paragraph is accurate:
>   "Code blocks and code spans" in `translation_approach.md` explains neither
>   the fenced block's trailing line feed nor the code span's edge trim. Item 6's
>   loss is explained by step 3 of "Emphasis and strong emphasis".
> * **Item 1.** `<pre>a  b\n\tc\n\n\nd</pre>` and `<pre>a\u{c}b</pre>` round-trip
>   exactly. `<pre>a\r\nb\rc\nd</pre>` gives `"<pre>a\nb\nc\nd</pre>"`.
>   `<pre>\n\na</pre>` gives `"<pre>\na</pre>"`, then `"<pre>a</pre>"`.
>   `<pre><code>a</code></pre>` comes back as `"<pre><code>a\n</code></pre>\n"`.
>   The fenced block keeps leading blank lines, spaces and tabs (also in a list
>   item and a blockquote, where htmd indents or prefixes each line and
>   pulldown-cmark strips that again). Raw `<pre>` in a list item, after text in a
>   list item, in a blockquote and in a blockquote list round-trips exactly. In
>   `<h1>` and in a pipe-table cell, `<pre>` and `<pre><code>` collapse to
>   `"<pre>a b c</pre>"` and are idempotent. In a headerless table,
>   `<pre>a\n\nb</pre>` gives `"...<pre>a\n&#10;b</pre>..."` (idempotent), and the
>   leading line feed bug reproduces.
> * **Item 2.** `x<code>a  \tb</code>y` keeps its runs. Edge spaces, tabs and line
>   endings are dropped (``"x`a`y"``). Edge form feed, NBSP and U+000B are kept.
>   Form-feed-only and NBSP-only spans are backtick spans. `<code></code>` goes raw.
>   An interior line ending goes raw and is not idempotent, and form feeds in
>   that raw inline collapse while NBSP is kept. A backtick span in a pipe table
>   keeps its runs (``"| `a  b` |"``).
> * **Item 3.** `"*   a\n\n    b"`, `"*   a\n    *   b"` and
>   `"1.  a\n\n    ```\n    x\n      y\n    ```"` round-trip. Four leading NBSP stay
>   a paragraph. Four leading spaces in a `<p>` are trimmed.
> * **Item 4.** `a<br>b`, `a <br> b`, `a<br/>b` round-trip as raw `<br>`.
>   `a<br>\nb` gives `"a<br> b"`. No case tried produced a line ending in a
>   paragraph: trailing spaces in `<li>` are trimmed, NBSP before `<br>` stays
>   before the raw tag, and a backslash before a line ending is escaped
>   (`"a\\\\ b"`).
> * **Item 5.** Line endings and blank lines in `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<li>` and `<a>`
>   give one space. In attributes they are encoded instead (`"![a&#10;b](u)"`,
>   `"[t](u \"a&#10;b\")"`), which is outside "HTML text". A headerless table keeps
>   them.
> * **Item 6.** `"a *b*c"`, `"a**b** c"`, and `"a<em> !b</em>c"` for punctuation.
>   Nested `<p><strong><em> b</em></strong></p>` gives `"<strong> *b*</strong>"`
>   and is idempotent. Trailing space at the end of `<p>` and a space after `<br>`
>   are fine. Links keep edge whitespace, including at the start of a paragraph
>   (`"[ b ](u)"`, idempotent). Whitespace-only `<em>` and `<strong>`, and empty
>   `<em>`, stay raw.
> * **Item 7.** Edge U+00A0, U+2003, U+1680, U+202F and U+000B move out of
>   emphasis. pulldown-cmark leaves `"*\u{a0}a*"`, `"*\u{1680}a*"`, `"*\u{85}a*"`
>   and `"*\u{b}a*"` literal. NBSP stays inside a link (`"x[\u{a0}t\u{a0}](u)y"`).
>   An NBSP-led emphasis at the start of a paragraph is idempotent
>   (`"\u{a0}*b*"`), unlike the ASCII case in E1.
> * **Item 8** (with `ENABLE_TABLES`). `"| a b |"`, `"| a<br>b |"`, `"| a |"`,
>   `"| <p>a</p><p>b</p> |"`, an edge NBSP kept (`"| \u{a0}a |"`) and a leading
>   emphasis space trimmed (`"| *b* |"`) all round-trip and are idempotent. A
>   headerless table is copied as it is (`&nbsp;` for NBSP). With empty options
>   the pipe table is a `<p>` and fails idempotency, as the item warns.
> * **"Does not matter", scope and 1-4.** `<div>`, `<textarea>` and raw inline
>   edges behave as stated (`"a <span> b</span>"` and `"a <span>b</span>"`

#### Escaping

Claude Opus 5.5 (Claude Code), with the prompt: "Review the section named "Escaping" in testing_approach.md, writing findings to review.md." Each round ran in a new session. This is the output of round 5; all its findings were applied.

> Review: "Escaping" section of testing_approach.md
> ===============================================
>
> Scope: `testing_approach.md` lines 84–118. Each claim was checked against
> `src/dom_walker.rs` (`escape_if_needed`, `is_markdown_block_start`,
> `is_markdown_inline_special`) and `src/util/escape.rs`, and every example in
> the section was run through Faithful mode and pulldown-cmark 0.13 (with
> `ENABLE_TABLES | ENABLE_MATH`) in a scratch crate outside the repo.
>
> All examples in the section produce the stated Markdown and round trip, and
> are idempotent: `\# a`, `\-`, `1\. a`, `\---`, `\- - -`, `--foo`, `#\nfoo`,
> `\<pre`, `` `a\|b` ``, `# a \#`, `\![a](x)`, ``` ``a`b`` ```,
> `a *b*\- c`, `# \# a`, `\#*b*`, `\#######`, `1234567890\.`, the pipe-table cell
> `\- c`, every near miss in rule 2 (`#x`, `--foo`, `1.)`, `2½.`, `-&nbsp;a`,
> `</ a`, `<123>`, `!<em>a</em>`, `<h2>a#</h2>`), the Setex/ATX pair for
> `<h2>- a</h2>`, and `<li><p>a</p> - b</li>`.
>
> Findings
> --------
>
> ### 1. Rule 4 misses a text node after a list sibling, where a real failure hides (medium)
>
> Rule 4 lists the places where a text node can start a line, including "a text
> node after a `<p>` or `<blockquote>` sibling". It omits a text node after a
> list sibling, and that case fails:
>
> ```
> <li><ul><li>a</li></ul>- b</li>
>   Markdown:   "*   *   a\n    \\- b"
>   round trip: <ul><li><ul><li>a\n- b</li></ul></li></ul>
>   idempotent: no
> ```
>
> The escape is written, but `\- b` is a lazy continuation of the nested item,
> so the text moves into it. This is the "block separation" kind of failure
> rule 4 already routes to "Known failures", but a suite built from the rule's
> list would never meet it. (After a `<pre>` sibling, and in a blockquote after a
> list, the text stays separate.)
>
> Suggestion: say "after a block sibling" and list `<p>`, `<blockquote>`, a list
> and `<pre>`, with `<li><ul><li>a</li></ul>- b</li>` as the list example.
>
> ### 2. "The start of a text node is the start of a line" does not hold mid-line (medium-low)
>
> Line 99 says htmd treats "the start of a text node as the start of a line".
> Mid-line, a text node which starts with whitespace keeps that whitespace, so
> `escape_if_needed` sees the space and escapes nothing (the comment at
> `src/dom_walker.rs:103` describes this):
>
> ```
> <p>a <em>b</em> - c</p>   ->  a *b* - c      (no escape)
> <p>a <em>b</em>- c</p>    ->  a *b*\- c      (over-escape)
> <p>a <em>b</em> 1. c</p>  ->  a *b* 1. c     (no escape)
> ```
>
> Leading whitespace is trimmed, and the marker behind it escaped, only at the
> start of a block (`<p> 1. foo</p>` gives `1\. foo`). A tester reading the
> first over-escape bullet could expect `a *b* \- c`.
>
> Suggestion: state that a text node's leading whitespace is dropped only at the
> start of a block, so mid-line the over-escape needs the marker to touch the
> sibling. Add `a <em>b</em> - c` (no escape) as the near miss for
> `a <em>b</em>- c`.
>
> ### 3. Item 2 names a line ending and a tab, but form feed is compressed too (low)
>
> Item 2: "A line ending or a tab after a marker is first compressed to a
> space". `compress_whitespace` treats every kind of HTML whitespace this way:
> `<p>-\ffoo</p>` gives `\- foo`. Rule 3 already requires a form-feed case, so
> item 2 and rule 3 disagree. Suggestion: "Any HTML whitespace after a marker
> (Whitespace section) is first compressed to a space".
>
> ### 4. Over-escape is defined twice, and the definitions come after the list which uses them (low)

> * `~~` mid-text is not escaped (`a ~~b~~`), as rule 5 says.
> * `!` before an image (`a!<img>` gives `a!![y](x)`) and a lone `!` need no
>   escape, consistent with item 5 naming only a link.
